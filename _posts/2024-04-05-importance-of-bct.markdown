<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">B</span>asic Combat Training (BCT) is the cornerstone of military simulation (Milsim) gameplay, replicating the initial training undergone by real military recruits. It covers essential skills such as weapon handling, squad maneuvers, communication, and first aid. BCT is crucial in Milsims as it ensures players understand fundamental military principles, fostering teamwork and immersion in virtual combat scenarios.</p>

### How is our BCT program different? 
Our BCT program at Shadow Division stands out from other Milsims by offering a unique blend of community engagement, mod diversity, and personalized guidance. Unlike traditional setups, our BCT sessions provide an excellent opportunity for players new and old to connect, meet fellow enthusiasts, and explore a plethora of available mods tailored to individual preferences. Moreover, participants benefit from private sessions designed to address queries about game mechanics, our operations, and gain deeper insights into our distinctive approach to gameplay and importantly our standard operation procedures (SOPs). Join us at Shadow Division for an immersive and informative BCT experience that sets the stage for a rewarding Milsim journey.

<blockquote>
"Each unit may have different SOPs. Thus, it's crucial to familiarize yourself with the specific procedures our unit will adhere to. Our tailored training sessions ensure that every member understands and can effectively implement these protocols in the field."
